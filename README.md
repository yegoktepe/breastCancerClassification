Despite the promising results from deep learning models, individual CNNs may not generalize well when applied to different datasets. By creating an ensemble of CNNs and combining their predictions, we aim to achieve a more accurate and robust model for breast cancer classification. This ensemble approach is expected to provide a more balanced representation of the data, capturing a variety of features to distinguish benign and malignant tumors effectively.
